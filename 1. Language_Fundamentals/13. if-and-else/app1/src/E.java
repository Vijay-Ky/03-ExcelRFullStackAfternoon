	{
		if(false)

/*
1. **Class Definition:**
    ```java
    class E 
    {
    ```
    - This is the beginning of the program. It defines a class named `E`.

2. **Main Method:**
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    ```
    - This is the main method, which serves as the entry point for the program. It takes an array of strings as its parameter.

3. **Condition Using if-else:**
    ```java
    if(false)
    {
        System.out.println("from if");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("from else");
    }
    ```
    - Here, an `if` statement is used to check a condition. However, the condition is explicitly set to `false`. This means that the code inside the `if` block will never be executed because the condition is always false.
    - The code within the `else` block will always be executed since the condition is false. Therefore, the output will be `"from else"`.

4. **Print Statement:**
    ```java
    System.out.println("from else");
    ```
    - This line prints the text `"from else"` to the console, as it is located inside the `else` block.

5. **Output:**
    ```
    from else
    ```
    - Since the `if` condition is `false`, the program skips the `if` block and enters the `else` block, resulting in the output being `"from else"`.

6. **Continuation of Main Method:**
    ```java
    System.out.println("main end");
    ```
    - This line of code is outside of the conditional blocks, so it will always be executed, regardless of the condition.

7. **Output:**
    ```
    main end
    ```
    - This line prints `"main end"` to the console after the previous output.

8. **Closing Braces:**
    ```java
    }
    ```
    - These closing braces mark the end of the `main` method and the `E` class.

So, the final output of the program will be:
```
from else
main end
```

In summary, this Java program demonstrates the behavior of an `if-else` statement with a false condition. Since the condition is false, the code in the `if` block is not executed, and the code in the `else` block is executed instead.
