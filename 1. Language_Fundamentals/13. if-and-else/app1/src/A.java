```java
1. class A
2. {
3.     public static void main(String[] args)
4.     {
5.         if(true)
6.             System.out.println(1);

10. }
```

1. `class A`: This line declares the start of a class named "A".

2. `{`: The opening curly brace marks the beginning of the class's code block.

3. `public static void main(String[] args)`: This line defines the `main` method, which serves as the entry point for the program. It takes an array of `String` arguments as a parameter.

4. `{`: The opening curly brace indicates the beginning of the `main` method's code block.

5. `if(true)`: This line starts an `if` statement. Since `true` is a constant boolean value that is always true, the condition will always evaluate to true, and the code block following it will be executed.

6. `System.out.println(1);`: This line prints the integer `1` to the console. Since it is within the code block of the `if` statement, it will be executed every time the `if` condition is true.

7. `System.out.println(2);`: This line is not indented and not enclosed in curly braces. It is outside the code block of the `if` statement. This means that it will be executed unconditionally, regardless of the outcome of the `if` condition.

8. `System.out.println(3);`: Similar to the previous line, this line is also not indented and not enclosed in curly braces. It will also be executed unconditionally.

9. `}`: The closing curly brace marks the end of the `main` method's code block.

10. `}`: The closing curly brace marks the end of the class's code block.

In summary, the behavior of the program is as follows:
- The `main` method starts executing.
- The `if` statement's condition is always true due to the constant value `true`.
- Therefore, the code block following the `if` statement is executed, resulting in the printing of `1` to the console.
- The subsequent `System.out.println(2);` and `System.out.println(3);` statements are executed unconditionally, resulting in the printing of `2` and `3` to the console.
- The program finishes its execution.

Please note that the indentation of code is crucial for understanding the intended control flow and scope in Java. In this case, indentation isn't present, which might lead to confusion if the intent was to group all three `System.out.println()` statements within the `if` block.
