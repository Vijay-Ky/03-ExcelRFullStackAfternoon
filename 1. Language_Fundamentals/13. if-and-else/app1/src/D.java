/*

1. **Class Definition**:
   - The program starts with the declaration of a class named `D`.

2. **Main Method**:
   - Inside the class, the `main` method is declared, which serves as the entry point of the program. It takes an array of `String` objects (`args`) as its parameter.

3. **If Statement**:
   - An `if` statement is used to control the flow of the program based on a condition. In this case, the condition is `true`, which means the block of code inside the `if` statement will always be executed.

4. **Opening Curly Brace `{`**:
   - The opening curly brace marks the beginning of the code block associated with the `if` statement.

5. **Print Statement Inside If Block**:
   - The `System.out.println("from if");` statement prints the text "from if" to the console.

6. **Closing Curly Brace `}` for If Block**:
   - The closing curly brace marks the end of the code block associated with the `if` statement.

7. **"main end" Print Statement**:
   - The `System.out.println("main end");` statement is located outside the `if` block. Regardless of the condition, this statement will always be executed because it is not enclosed within any conditional statement.

8. **Program Execution**:
   - When the program is run, the `main` method is the entry point.
   - The condition of the `if` statement is `true`, so the code inside the `if` block will be executed.
   - As a result, "from if" will be printed to the console.

9. **Output**:
   - The output on the console will be:
     ```
     from if
     main end
     ```

10. **Program Termination**:
   - Once the `main` method completes its execution, the program terminates.

In summary, the program contains a single `if` statement with a condition that is always `true`. Therefore, the code inside the `if` block is executed, and the statements within the `else` block are not executed. Finally, the statement outside the `if` block is executed, and the program ends after printing the output to the console.
