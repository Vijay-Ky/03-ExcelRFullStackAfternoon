/*

1. The program starts with the declaration of a class named `J`.

2. Inside the class, there is a `main` method declared with the standard signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`.

3. The main method begins with an `if` statement.

4. The condition of the first `if` statement is `false`. Since the condition is `false`, the code block within this `if` statement will not be executed. This means the program will skip to the corresponding `else` statement.

5. Immediately after the first `if` statement, there is another `if` statement without its own condition. This second `if` statement is nested within the `else` block of the first `if` statement. This nesting creates a situation where the second `if` is only evaluated if the first `if` condition was `false`.

6. The condition of the second `if` statement is `true`. Since this condition is `true`, the code block within this `if` statement will be executed. This code block contains a single statement: `System.out.println("inner if");`.

7. As a result of the second `if` statement being `true`, the output "inner if" will be printed to the console.

8. After the execution of the nested `if` statement, the program will exit the `if-else` chain and continue executing the subsequent code.

9. There is no further code within the `main` method, so the program will reach the end of the method and subsequently, the end of the class.

10. The program execution concludes.

In summary, the given program demonstrates the concept of nested `if` and `else` statements. However, due to the nature of the conditions (`false` for the first `if` and `true` for the nested `if`), only the code block within the nested `if` statement will be executed, resulting in the output "inner if" being printed to the console.
