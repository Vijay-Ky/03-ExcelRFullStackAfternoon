/*

1. The program defines a class named `B`.

2. The `main` method is declared within the class `B` with the signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`.

3. The program enters the `main` method when it is executed.

4. An `if` statement is encountered with the condition `false`. Since the condition is `false`, the code block associated with the `if` statement will not be executed.

5. The program encounters the `System.out.println(1);` statement. However, this statement is **not** within the code block of the `if` statement, because there are no curly braces `{}` enclosing it. It is important to note that in Java, indentation does not affect the structure of code blocks; only curly braces do.

6. The program proceeds to execute the `System.out.println(2);` statement. Like the previous statement, this one is **not** within the code block of the `if` statement either.

7. Similarly, the program executes the `System.out.println(3);` statement, which is also **not** within the code block of the `if` statement.

8. The program finishes executing the `main` method and reaches the end of the program.

In summary, the output of this program will be:

```
2
3
```

The reason is that the `if` condition is `false`, so the code block associated with it is skipped entirely. The `System.out.println(1);` statement is not affected by the `if` condition since it's not enclosed in the code block. As a result, only the statements `System.out.println(2);` and `System.out.println(3);` are executed, printing "2" and "3" respectively.
