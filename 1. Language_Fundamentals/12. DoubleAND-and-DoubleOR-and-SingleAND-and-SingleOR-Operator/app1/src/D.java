/*

1. The program defines a class named `D`.

2. Inside the `D` class, there's a `main` method, which is the entry point of the program. It accepts an array of `String` arguments (`args`), although these arguments aren't used in this program.

3. Inside the `main` method, an integer variable `i` is declared and initialized with the value `0`.

4. There's an `if` statement with a condition:
   - `(i++ == 1)` is the first part of the condition. It compares the current value of `i` (which is `0`) with `1`. The post-increment operator `i++` is used, so the value of `i` is compared first and then incremented.
   - `(i++ == 1)` is the second part of the condition. After the first comparison, the value of `i` is now `1` due to the post-increment operation. It is again compared with `1`.

5. The `&&` operator is used to combine the two conditions. It's a short-circuit logical AND operation. This means that if the first condition evaluates to `false`, the second condition is not evaluated, since the overall result will be `false` regardless.

6. Since the first condition `(i++ == 1)` evaluates to `false` (`1` is not equal to `0`), the short-circuit behavior prevents the second condition `(i++ == 1)` from being evaluated. This means that the second post-increment operation doesn't take place.

7. Since the condition inside the `if` statement is `false`, the block of code within the `if` statement is not executed. The following lines of code are skipped:
   - `System.out.println("from if");`
   - `i++;`

8. The program continues execution after the `if` statement. The following line is executed:
   - `System.out.println("end of main");` This line prints "end of main" to the console.

9. The next line is executed:
   - `System.out.println(i);` This line prints the value of `i` (which is `1` after the previous post-increment operation) to the console.

10. The `main` method finishes its execution, and the program terminates.

In summary, due to the short-circuit behavior of the `&&` operator and the fact that the first condition evaluates to `false`, the code block within the `if` statement is not executed. As a result, "from if" is not printed, and the value of `i` remains `1` after the two post-increment operations. The output of the program will be:
```
end of main
1
```
