/*

1. **Class Definition:**
   ```java
   class E
   {
   ```
   The program begins with the declaration of a class named `E`.

2. **Main Method:**
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
   ```
   The `main` method is the entry point of the program and is where the execution starts. It takes an array of strings `args` as input, though in this program, `args` is not used.

3. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```java
   int i = 0;
   ```
   Declare and initialize an integer variable `i` with the value `0`.

4. **Conditional Statement (if):**
   ```java
   if((++i == 1) && (i++ == 2))
   {
   ```
   An `if` statement is used to create a conditional block. The condition checks two sub-conditions:
   
   a. `++i == 1`: Increment `i` and check if the incremented value is equal to `1`.
   b. `i++ == 2`: Check if the current value of `i` is equal to `2` and then increment `i`.
   
   The `&&` operator ensures that both sub-conditions are true for the overall condition to be true. However, the second sub-condition (`i++ == 2`) will not be evaluated if the first sub-condition (`++i == 1`) is false due to short-circuiting.

5. **Print from "if" Block:**
   ```java
   System.out.println("from if");
   ```
   If both sub-conditions of the `if` statement are true, this line will be executed and print "from if" to the console.

6. **Incrementing i within "if" Block:**
   ```java
   i++;
   ```
   This line increments the value of `i` by 1 within the "if" block.

7. **Closing "if" Block:**
   ```java
   }
   ```
   Closes the "if" block.

8. **Print "end of main":**
   ```java
   System.out.println("end of main");
   ```
   This line prints "end of main" to the console regardless of whether the "if" block was executed or not.

9. **Print the Value of i:**
   ```java
   System.out.println(i);
   ```
   This line prints the value of `i` (which could be `2` if both conditions within the "if" block were true or `1` if the first condition was false) to the console.

10. **Closing Main Method:**
    ```java
    }
    ```
    Closes the `main` method.

11. **Closing Class Definition:**
    ```java
    }
    ```
    Closes the class definition.

In summary, this program demonstrates the behavior of post-increment and pre-increment operators within a conditional statement (`if`) block. The value of `i` may change based on whether the conditions are satisfied and how the increments are applied. The output to the console will vary based on these conditions.
