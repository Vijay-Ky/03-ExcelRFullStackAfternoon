/*

1. Program Initialization:
   - The program begins with the declaration of a Java class named `A`.

2. Class `A` Definition:
   - The class `A` contains a single method named `main` which serves as the entry point for the program's execution. The `main` method is declared with the `public static` modifiers, indicating that it can be accessed from anywhere and without creating an instance of the class.

3. Method `main` Declaration:
   - The `main` method is declared to take an array of `String` objects as an argument (`String[] args`), which allows command-line arguments to be passed to the program.

4. Beginning of the `main` Method Execution:
   - The execution of the `main` method begins.

5. `if` Statement:
   - An `if` statement is encountered. It starts with the keyword `if` followed by an opening parenthesis `(`.

6. Condition Evaluation:
   - The condition within the parentheses is evaluated: `true && true`.

7. Logical AND (`&&`) Operator:
   - The logical AND operator (`&&`) is used to combine two boolean values.
   - Both operands are `true`.

8. Condition Evaluation Result:
   - The result of the condition evaluation is `true`, as both sides of the `&&` operator are `true`.

9. Code Block Execution (if condition is true):
   - Since the condition within the `if` statement is `true`, the code block associated with the `if` statement is executed.

10. Printing "from if":
   - The statement `System.out.println("from if");` is executed.
   - As a result, the text "from if" is printed to the console.

11. End of `if` Statement Block:
   - The code block associated with the `if` statement has been executed.

12. Continuation of Program Execution:
   - The program execution continues to the next line after the `if` statement block.

13. Printing "end of main":
   - The statement `System.out.println("end of main");` is executed.
   - The text "end of main" is printed to the console.

14. End of Method Execution:
   - The execution of the `main` method is complete.

15. Program Termination:
   - The program execution comes to an end.

Summary:
- The program defines a class `A` with a `main` method.
- Within the `main` method, there's an `if` statement with a condition of `true && true`.
- Since both sides of the logical AND operator are `true`, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.
- The text "from if" is printed to the console.
- After the `if` block, the text "end of main" is printed.
- The program terminates after the execution of the `main` method.

Output:
```
from if
end of main
```

Note: The conditions in this program are constant and will always evaluate to the same values. Therefore, the behavior of the program is deterministic, and the output will always be the same regardless of the execution.
