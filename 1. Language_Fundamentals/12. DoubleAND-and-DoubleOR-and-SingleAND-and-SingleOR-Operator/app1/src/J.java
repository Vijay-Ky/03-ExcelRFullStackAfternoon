/*

1. The program starts with the declaration of a class named `J`.

2. Inside the class, there is a `main` method defined: `public static void main(String[] args)`

3. Within the `main` method, an integer variable `i` is declared and initialized to `0`: `int i = 0;`

4. An `if` statement is used to create a conditional block:
   ```
   if((++i == 1) || (i++ == 2))
   {
       System.out.println("from if");
       i++;
   }
   ```

   4.1. `(++i == 1)` is a pre-increment operation on `i`, which increments the value of `i` to `1` and returns `true` since the condition `1 == 1` is satisfied.

   4.2. `(i++ == 2)` is a post-increment operation on `i`, which checks if the value of `i` (which is `1` at this point) is equal to `2`. This condition evaluates to `false` since `1` is not equal to `2`.

   4.3. Since the condition `(++i == 1)` is `true` and it's connected with the logical OR `||` operator, the second condition `(i++ == 2)` is not evaluated. This is due to short-circuiting behavior of the logical OR operator.

   4.4. The code block within the `if` statement executes because the first condition was `true`. It prints `"from if"` using `System.out.println("from if");`.

   4.5. `i` is then incremented once more using `i++;`, making its value `2`.

5. The control flow continues outside the `if` block.

6. The program prints `"end of main"` using `System.out.println("end of main");`.

7. The program prints the value of `i` using `System.out.println(i);`. At this point, the value of `i` is `2`.

8. The `main` method ends.

9. The program execution completes.

To summarize, the program increments the value of `i` using pre-increment, evaluates conditions using logical operators, and executes code blocks based on the evaluation of those conditions. It then prints out the results of those operations and the final value of `i`.
