/*

1. **Program Start**: The program starts with the declaration of a class named `G`.

2. **Main Method Declaration**: Inside the class `G`, the `main` method is declared with the following signature:
   ```
   public static void main(String[] args)
   ```
   This is the entry point of the program.

3. **If Statement**: The program enters an `if` statement with the condition `false || true`. Let's break down this condition:
   - `false`: This is a boolean literal with the value `false`.
   - `||`: This is the logical OR operator.
   - `true`: This is a boolean literal with the value `true`.

4. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - Since the condition involves a logical OR (`||`) operator, it evaluates to `true` if at least one of its operands is `true`. Here, the second operand is `true`, so the entire condition evaluates to `true`.

5. **If Block Execution**: Because the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to `true`, the code block inside the `if` block is executed:
   ```
   System.out.println("from if");
   ```
   This statement prints the string "from if" to the console.

6. **Print Statement Execution**:
   After executing the code block within the `if` block, the program moves outside the `if` block and reaches the following statement:
   ```
   System.out.println("end of main");
   ```
   This statement prints the string "end of main" to the console.

7. **Program End**: The `main` method execution is completed, and the program finishes.

8. **Console Output**:
   Based on the code execution, the following will be printed to the console:
   ```
   from if
   end of main
   ```

In summary, the program defines a class with a `main` method. It contains an `if` statement with a condition that evaluates to `true`, so the code block within the `if` statement is executed, printing "from if" to the console. Then, the program proceeds to print "end of main" and terminates.
