1. The program begins with the declaration of a class named `E`. In Java, the class name should start with an uppercase letter, which is the case here. The class definition is enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

2. Inside the class `E`, there's a `public static void main(String[] args)` method declaration. This method serves as the entry point for the Java program and is where the program's execution begins. The `main` method accepts an array of strings as its parameter, commonly used for command-line arguments.

3. The code within the `main` method starts by declaring an integer variable `i` and initializing it with the value `10`.

4. Next, there's an `if` statement. The condition being checked is `i != 10`, which means "if `i` is not equal to 10". However, since the previous line initialized `i` with the value `10`, this condition will evaluate to `false`.

5. Inside the `if` block, which only executes if the condition is `true`, there is a single statement: `System.out.println("from if");`. This statement prints the string "from if" to the standard output (usually the console).

6. After the `if` block, there's a line outside of any conditional block. This line contains `System.out.println("end of main");`, which prints the string "end of main" to the standard output.

7. Since the condition in the `if` statement (i.e., `i != 10`) is `false`, the code within the `if` block does not execute. Instead, the program proceeds directly to the line following the `if` block.

8. The program execution continues to the line with the `System.out.println("end of main");` statement. This line is not within any conditional block, so it is executed regardless of the `if` condition's outcome.

9. Finally, the execution of the `main` method concludes. This marks the end of the program's execution.

To summarize, the program initializes an integer variable `i` with the value `10`. It then checks whether `i` is not equal to 10. Since this condition is `false`, the code within the `if` block doesn't execute. Regardless of the `if` condition's outcome, the program prints "end of main" to the console, demonstrating that the execution follows a linear path through the code.
