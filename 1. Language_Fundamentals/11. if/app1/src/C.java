/*

1. **Class Definition**: The program defines a class named `C`.

2. **Main Method Declaration**: Within the `C` class, there is a `public static void main(String[] args)` method declaration. This is the entry point of the program and is executed when the program is run.

3. **If Statement**: Inside the `main` method, there is an `if` statement. The condition within the `if` statement is `false`, which means the condition will never be satisfied, and the code block inside the `if` statement will never be executed.

4. **If Block**: Since the condition is `false`, the code block inside the `if` statement will be skipped entirely. This code block contains the statement `System.out.println("from if");`, which would have printed "from if" to the console if the condition were `true`.

5. **Print Statement**: Immediately after the `if` statement, there is a `System.out.println("end of main");` statement. This statement will always be executed regardless of whether the `if` condition is `true` or `false`.

6. **Print Output**: As a result of the program execution, the statement `System.out.println("end of main");` will print "end of main" to the console.

7. **Program Completion**: After printing the output, the program execution will come to an end.

In summary, this program contains an `if` statement with a condition that is always `false`. As a result, the code block within the `if` statement is never executed, and only the statement after the `if` statement is executed, which prints "end of main" to the console. The output of running this program will be:
```
end of main
```
