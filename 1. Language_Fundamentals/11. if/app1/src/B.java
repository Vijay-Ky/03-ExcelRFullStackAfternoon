1. **Class Declaration**: The program starts with the declaration of a class named `B`.

2. **Main Method Declaration**: Within the class `B`, there is a public static method named `main`, which is the entry point of the program. This method takes a single argument, an array of strings `args`, although it's not used in this program.

3. **If Statement**: The program enters the `main` method. The first executable statement is an `if` statement: `if(true)`. This `if` statement has a condition that is always `true`. Consequently, the code block within this `if` statement will always be executed.

4. **Print "from if"**: Inside the `if` block, there is a single statement: `System.out.println("from if");`. This statement prints the string "from if" to the console.

5. **End of If Block**: The `if` block concludes here, as there are no more statements inside it.

6. **Print "end of main"**: After the `if` block, there is another statement outside the `if` block: `System.out.println("end of main");`. This statement prints the string "end of main" to the console.

7. **End of Main Method**: The last statement in the `main` method is executed, indicating the end of the method.

8. **Program Execution Completes**: Since there is no more code in the program, the program execution completes here.

To summarize, this program does the following:

- The program enters the `main` method.
- The `if` statement with a condition that is always `true` ensures that its code block is always executed.
- Inside the `if` block, "from if" is printed to the console.
- After the `if` block, "end of main" is printed to the console.
- The `main` method execution completes, and the program terminates.

Keep in mind that the `if` statement condition is hardcoded to `true`, which means the code inside the `if` block will always run. In practice, `if` statements are generally used with conditions that can evaluate to either `true` or `false` based on dynamic conditions.
