/*

1. The program starts with the declaration of a class named `N`.

2. Inside the class `N`, there is a `public static void main(String[] args)` method declaration. This method serves as the entry point for the program execution.

3. Within the `main` method, a boolean variable `flag` is declared and initialized with the value `false`. This variable is used to control the flow of the program.

4. An `if` statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code based on the value of the `flag` variable. The condition being checked is `flag == true`, which checks whether the `flag` is equal to `true`. In this case, the condition will evaluate to `false` since `flag` is initialized to `false`.

5. Since the condition of the `if` statement is `false`, the code block inside the `if` statement will not be executed. Therefore, the line `System.out.println("from if");` will be skipped.

6. The program then proceeds to the next line outside the `if` statement, which contains the code `System.out.println("end of main");`. This line prints the string "end of main" to the console.

7. Following that, another line `System.out.println(flag);` is executed. This line prints the value of the `flag` variable to the console. Since the value of `flag` is `false`, it will print `false`.

8. The `main` method is now complete, and the program execution reaches its end.

9. The program concludes, and the control returns to the operating system.

To summarize, this program initializes a boolean variable `flag` with the value `false`. It then uses an `if` statement to check whether `flag` is equal to `true`, but since `flag` is `false`, the code block inside the `if` statement is not executed. The program prints "end of main" to the console and then prints the value of `flag` (which is `false`) to the console before it terminates.
