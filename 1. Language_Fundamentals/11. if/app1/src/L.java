/*

1. Program starts with the declaration of a class named `L`.

2. Inside the class, there is a `main` method declared using the syntax `public static void main(String[] args)`. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it's the method that will be executed when the program runs.

3. The opening curly brace `{` for the `main` method marks the beginning of the method's code block.

4. Inside the `main` method, there's an `if` statement. The `if` statement is used for conditional execution of code based on a specified condition.

5. `if(!false)` - This line checks the condition within the parentheses. Here, `!false` is used. The `!` symbol is a logical NOT operator, which inverts the value of the operand. Since the operand is `false`, applying `!` to it makes it `true`.

6. Since the condition within the `if` statement evaluates to `true`, the code block within the following curly braces `{}` will be executed.

7. Inside the `if` block, there's a single line of code: `System.out.println("from if");`. This line prints the text "from if" to the console.

8. After executing the code within the `if` block, the program continues to the next line outside of the `if` block.

9. `System.out.println("end of main");` - This line prints the text "end of main" to the console. It's important to note that this line is not inside the `if` block, so it will be executed regardless of the outcome of the `if` condition.

10. The closing curly brace `}` marks the end of the `main` method's code block.

11. Since there are no more statements in the program, the program execution finishes.

In summary, the program starts by defining a class named `L` with a `main` method. Inside the `main` method, there is an `if` statement that checks a condition (`!false`), which is always `true` because it negates the value of `false`. As a result, the code inside the `if` block is executed, printing "from if" to the console. After that, the program prints "end of main" to the console and concludes.
