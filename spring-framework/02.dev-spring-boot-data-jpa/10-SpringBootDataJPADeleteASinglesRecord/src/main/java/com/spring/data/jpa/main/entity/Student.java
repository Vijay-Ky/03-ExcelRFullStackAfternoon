/*
The @Entity annotation in the Spring Framework is used to mark a Java class as an entity. An entity is a persistent object that is mapped to a table in a relational database. The @Entity annotation tells Spring Data JPA that the class should be managed by the persistence layer.

The @Entity annotation can be used on any Java class that meets the following requirements:

- The class must have a public no-argument constructor.
- The class must have a primary key.
- The class must have getter and setter methods for all of its properties.

why there should be a default constructor in the @Entity class??
- JPA requires all entity classes to have a default constructor. This is because JPA uses reflection to create instances of entity classes.

    -The @Id annotation is used to mark the property that is the primary key of the entity. In this case, the primary key is the id property.
    - The @Id annotation can be used on any field type, but it is most commonly used on integer or long fields. The value of the primary key field must be unique for each row in the table.
    - When using the @Id annotation, you can also specify the generation strategy for the primary key value. The default generation strategy is auto-increment, which means that the database will automatically generate a unique value for each new row.

    - The @GeneratedValue annotation in the Spring framework is used to specify how the primary key value for an entity is generated. It is typically used in conjunction with the @Id annotation
