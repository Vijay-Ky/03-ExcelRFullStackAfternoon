/*
- The @Repository annotation in the Spring framework is used to mark a class as a repository. A repository is a class that provides access to data.
- The @Repository annotation is a specialization of the @Component annotation. This means that any class annotated with @Repository will also be automatically detected by Spring's dependency injection mechanism
- When using the @Repository annotation, you typically need to extend one of the Spring Data repository interfaces.
- These interfaces provide common methods for performing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on data.

    Create a new entity.
    Update an existing entity.
    Delete an existing entity.
    Find an entity by its primary key.
    Query for entities that match a certain criteria.
    Persist changes to entities to the database.
    Roll back changes to entities.
