Map
----------
1. Map is a seperate interface, it doesnt comes under Collection interface. but it also under collection API or collection framework
2. By using put method we can add elements to the map object
3. each entry will considered as one entry object.
4. put method accepts two arguments key and values
5. in the map objects are stored in the form key and value pairs.
6. key can be empty ? NO
7. value can be empty? NO
8. key can be null ? yes, a seperate bucked will be allocated for null entry. 
Note: if you adding another entry with key as null, the latest null entry will be replacing the older entry(latest value will be considered)
9. Both key and values are objects.
10. value can null for more than one entry. possible
11. duplicate keys will not be allowed, if duplicate keys are there the latest will be considered(but  we dont get any CTE or RTE)
12. Order of addition will not be preserved.
13. Map container indation would be using {}
14. we can get the value associate with a key by using 'get(key)' method
15.we can fetch all the keys of one map object by calling 'keySet()' method on map reference.
16. In order to represent group of objects in the form of key and value pairs we can use Map.
17. In order to preseve the order of addition we can use LinkedHashMap. 
18. values can duplicate
